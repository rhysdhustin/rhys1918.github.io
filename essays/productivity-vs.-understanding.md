## I. Introduction

During my time in ICS 314, AI became a regular part of my everyday workflow due to the fast-paced structure of the course and the increasing complexity of assignments. Like many other students, I sued AI as a support tool rather than a replacement for learning. I primarily relied on **ChatGPT**, **Claude** ,and **Copilot** to assist with understanding concepts, debugging issues, complete repetivit tasks, and double-checking my work. In software engineering, these tools were especially helpful for streamlining code genertation and troubleshooting issues.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

### 1. Experience WODs

At the beginning of the course, I rarely used AI because I thought I could complete certain WODs on time on my own without the help of AI. As exercises became more complex and take more effort and time to solve the issue within the time limit, I started to use AI for debugging, clarification, and generate skeleton code to help me when I was struck on an issue.

### 2. In-class Practice WODs

I initially avoided using AI during In-class Practice WODs to help me better understand what I will doing in the WOD. But as time constraints and tasks within the WOD began to start to be diffcult to complete, I used AI more frequently to help solve these issues. At times, I relied too heavily on AI-generated solutions instead of fully understanding the problem, though it was still helpful for debugging. Later, I went back to review the AI-generated solutions and I understand why it solved this way than the idea I thought it was going to work for the WOD.

### 3. In-class WODs

During In-class WODs were it was heavily graded and time was against you, I often used AI as a safety net to help solve these WODs, After failing some early WODs within the the time limit, I prioritized protecting my grade and I used AI to help generate summary responses on reqiurements on the WOD or generate skeleton code to work. Even though if that it meant sacrificing understanding and learning from the WOD, I believe reviewing the response and what I did in the WOD helps reflect why used AI in the first place and where should I improve to rely on AI less during WODs.

### 4. Essays

For the writting portions for essays, I used AI to help with giving off ideas to use and for the basic grammer and clarity checks to if the overall flow of the essay was well written.

### 5. Final Project

AI played a major role in my final project, where I used Claude and Copilot to debug crashes, resolve ESlint errors, brainstorm ideas,generate small sections of the code, resolve merge conflicts, and troubleshoot some issues on the backend like database login errors or not loading information from the database.

### 6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial

I rarely used AI to relearn concepts directly and spen limited time reviewing course material over the weekends.

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord

I did not use AI for answering questions on Discord, but I used AI in class since our professor would encourage us to ask AI to find the answer to question he just proposed in class.

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question

I rarely asked AI smart questions, but when I did, I already knew what I wanted to ask, so AI was not needed.

### 9. Coding Example

In the case of asking AI to give me coding examples, I didn't ask to generate a coding example since I can probly find an example through online resources and the logic of the example coming from AI could be wrong.

### 10. Explaining Code

At times when I code not understand some sections of the code, I would ask AI to help and summaries and explanation of what the code is about. Otherwise, I didn't ask AI to explain what the code did since I could understand the logic behind it.

### 11. Writing Code

I occasionally relied on AI to generate code snippets to help fix small tasks or issues, then test and iterated on it unitl it met my needs.

### 12. Documenting Code

Althrouhg AI would documenting code at more simplier and easy to do, I did not use AI to documnet code sections since I didn't felt it was nesscary to do when using AI in this way.

### 13. Quality Assurance

For quality assurance, at first I tried to resolve the issues myself. If it was unsuccessful, I would Copilot to help with making quick fixes or pasted errors I found into ChatGPT or Claude.

### 14. Other Uses in ICS 314

For using AI in other uses in ICS 314, I did not use AI for any additional ways beyond was listed in my personal experince in AI within this course.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Overall, I think AI hindered my understanding of key concepts. While I did gain exposure to many tools and workflow, my understanding of key concepts was often shallow since AI would reduced the need to reason through certain problems independently.

---

## IV. Practical Applications

Outside of this course, I have seen AI used in other group projects to help seed up development, assist with debugging, reduce errors and tome to complete certain issues. However, its effectiveness depends on the user’s understanding of the underlying concepts when complete these tasks.

---

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

One major challenge was relying on AI without understand _why_ a solutiong would worked in this way. Without understanding the reason why it worked, excessive use of AI would lead to dependence on the tool to solve issues and would lead to repeated issues to appear rather than making any progress on fixin the issue.

---

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Using AI to learn new concepts has reduce my motivation, engagement, and knowledge retention over using AI learn new concepts. Since AI can solve and provide solutions quickly, I would spend less time actively struggling with problem, which limited my understanding in the topic. When thinking of using traditional methods to learn new concepts, I think it would better for since it helps me tackle diffcult challenges for me solve independently and futher motivate me to reten knowledge to go over these hurdles. When grades are heavily emphasized, it becomes tempting to use AI since it can achieve solutions quickly, but I think traditional methods to learn is better for long run when retenting knowledge you would need for the future.

---

## VII. Future Considerations

Even with AI being useful to solve issues quickly, it still has drawbacks and limations when using it in software engineering. It should be used as tool to help active learning rather than a substitute to avoid weakening skills.

---

## VIII. Conclusion

My experince with using AI in ICS 314 was mixed. While AI tools improved my efficiency and helped solve diffucult issues I faced, using AI has cost me learning and engaging new concept. When considering the future, I think the idea of how this course encourage students to use AI to enhance their understanding and use it as a tool to enhance their skils rather replace them is a good concept to keep in mind.
