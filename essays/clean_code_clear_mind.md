## Clean Code, Clear Mind

When most people hear the phrase “coding standards,” they think of small details: whether to use two spaces or four for indentation, or where the curly braces should go. Those details do matter, but after my first week of using **ESLint with VSCode**, I’ve started to see that coding standards are about much more than formatting. They are about writing code that is readable, consistent, and maintainable—not just by me, but by anyone who might work with it in the future.

## Painful or Useful?

At first, ESLint felt more painful than useful. The red underlines and constant error messages made me wonder if I was even writing code “correctly” at all. I spent more time fixing semicolons and spacing issues than thinking about the actual logic of my program. But as I pushed through those early frustrations, I realized something important: ESLint wasn’t punishing me—it was teaching me. By following the rules, I started noticing patterns in my own coding habits, some of which made my code harder to read. The “pain” slowly turned into practice, and the practice became learning.

## Coding Standards as a Learning Tool

One surprising discovery is how coding standards can actually help you **learn a programming language**. For example, I caught myself writing JavaScript in a sloppy, C-style way at first. ESLint flagged those mistakes, forcing me to adjust and, in the process, internalize better JavaScript practices. In this way, coding standards become like training wheels: they might feel restrictive, but they help me avoid bad habits early on. Over time, those rules become second nature, and my code looks professional without me having to think twice about it.

## Beyond the Individual

Another perspective I’ve gained is that coding standards are not just about my personal style. They are about making sure a team of developers can collaborate without tripping over inconsistent code. If I hand off a project to someone else, I don’t want them wasting hours trying to interpret my quirky formatting. Standards eliminate that barrier, allowing the focus to stay on solving problems rather than deciphering syntax. In that sense, coding standards are a form of respect—for the project, the team, and even for my future self.

## Final Thoughts

So, do I agree that coding standards are one of the most important software engineering techniques? Absolutely. They might not be glamorous, but they build the foundation for everything else: collaboration, readability, and long-term maintainability. My first week with ESLint has been both frustrating and enlightening, but I can already tell that sticking to coding standards will pay off in the long run. The small details add up to something much bigger: clean, professional, and reliable code.
