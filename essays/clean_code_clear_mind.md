## Setting the Stage
When I first started to program, I thought of coding standards as a trivial matter. Did it really matter if I used tabs or spaces, if my curly braces were on the same line, or even if my comments in my code needed to be uniform with each other? Over time, I began working with various programming languages, including **Java, JavaScript, HTML, C++, and Python**. I began to realize that coding standards are much more than looking aesthetically pleasing; they are about communication, maintainability, and learning the “language of developers.”  

## Why Coding Standards Matter
Each programming language I have used highlights different challenges.  
- In **Java**, consistency in naming conventions and indentation makes large object-oriented projects manageable.  
- In **C++**, strict standards prevent errors that can hide in complex memory management.  
- In **Python**, the enforced indentation rules practically become a built-in standard.  
- In **JavaScript** and **HTML**, loose syntax rules can lead to chaos unless coding standards are applied.  

From this, I have learned that coding standards are not arbitrary; they make collaboration possible. When code is consistent, it makes it feel familiar, no matter who wrote it. This makes it crucial when reading old code or working on team projects.  

## ESLint in VSCode: Painful but Useful
I already had experience using **VSCode** before this course back in high school, so I was familiar with downloading extensions, debugging tools, etc. However, I never heard of or used **ESLint**, which made it a completely different experience. During my first week of using it, I felt like it was nitpicking at everything I wrote. After writing my code and establishing that it "worked", ESLint would flag it as a small issue. At first, I felt it was frustrating to deal with and time-consuming to fix during the WOD practices.

But after fixing enough warnings and errors, I noticed that my code naturally started to look cleaner and more consistent with itself. ESLint acted like a real-time teacher by not just pointing out the mistakes being made in my code, but helped me understand *why* they were mistakes and errors in the code. Now I see why it is one of the most valuable tools to use in VSCode for improving both syntax and style. 

## Personal Insights and Lessons Learned
Working across multiple languages has shown me that coding standards aren’t just a tool; they are a mindset to help guide us along. They push me to think about clarity, maintainability, and whether it is readable for others to look at.  

- In **Java**, consistent conventions for naming, package structure, and Javadoc comments make large, object-oriented codebases easier to navigate and maintain, while itself displaying strong typing and idiomatic patterns help prevent design-level surprises.
- In **Python**, I appreciate how PEP 8 provides a shared foundation for readability and idiomatic structure.
- In **C++**, standards help prevent subtle errors like memory management and object lifetimes, which can help that can cost hours of debugging.
- In **JavaScript**, using ESLint in VSCode acts like a teacher and safety net that helps you move towards  safer patterns and clearer code.
- Even in **HTML**, small standards like consistent indentation and attribute ordering make large files much easier to navigate.

Looking back, I realize coding standards have made me a more disciplined programmer. Instead of rushing through just to get working code, I now pause to ask: *Is this readable? Will this make sense later?*  

## Conclusion
Coding standards may look like small details, but they build the foundation of high-quality software. For me, using the ESLint extension in VSCode was both painful and useful. It helped me to confront bad habits and replace them with better ones. Across languages I have learned, seeing how coding standards save time and reduce errors makes collaboration smoother.

If I had to choose a practice to improve as a programmer, it would have to be writing code that is consistent, readable, and maintainable. Coding standard is not just about style. It is about following a standard that allows clarity, consistency, and leaving behind a trail for others can rely on.
