## Structuring Order from Chaos: How Design Patterns Help Build Software

Building software is like organizing a lost and found room, where if you don't have a clear system in place, items can get misplaced, people get frustrated, and it makes a simple task into a hard challenge to solve. Design patterns in software development is like a proven organizing method, that helps solve these issues by having developers arrange code so it's consistent, easy to understand, and simple to improve

Design patterns aren’t complete solutions, but rather reusable approaches that help solve common problems in a reliable way. Just as sorting items by category or date helps manage a lost and found room efficiently, design patterns help structure software to handle repeated challenges smoothly.

## Design Patterns in My Lost and Found Group Project

In my group project, we creared a Lost and Found webapp called Rainbow Reclamation. To help kepp the project stay organized, we used serval commin design patterns to help us keep moving forward. We used React componets to help break the user interface into small and reusebale pieces, which males the webapp easier to maintain and modify. For example, forms for submiting lost items or to browse a list of lost items follow this pattern. We also apply the Singleton pattern by using a single shared connection to our PostgresSQL database, which helped improve efficiency and resource use. Our webapp uses Node.js and Next.js to help hande the backend and server-side rendering, while Bootstrap helps us build a consisent and responsive user interface for people to use on diferent devices. Finally, our webapp loosely follows along the Model-View-Controller pattern in where is separates the database models, user interface views, and logic control. This separation helps keep our code to stay organized and makes it easy for the team to work together. Overall, these patterns in our project helps us develop new features, fix errors, and make improvements without scribbling around to find solutions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, design patterns are essential because it helps bring order to complex software projects. Like a good organizing system makes a lost and found manageable, design patterns make software predictable and maintainable.

Using these patterns in Rainbow Reclamation has helped us build an webapp that is easier to navigate and us improve on new or exisitng features. Getting to know these patterns also prepares me to build better software in future projects to come.
